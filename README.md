### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I prefer not to give my name, but you can just call me sbeve.

Currently I'm trying to expand my programming knowledge in general, but I'd say I'm fluent in javascript/typescript and like to work on projects related to Minecraft and Discord but honestly I'm open to anything.

I'm generally a big fan of OSS and try to make my projects as open source as possible, even if they're really small. I mean, that's why I'm on github after all!

If you want to contact me, you can find me at Discord (sbeve#4701). You can also email me (mygizli04@gmail.com).
